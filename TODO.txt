DONE - add an include statement - use #{name} 

DONE - update makefile names and install location - change install to user folder and make installations more understandable

explain in makefile what inline means

update readme to exaplin includes and general update

maybe later:
	make a version of paranteses skipping with stl so u dont have to use skipping_loop state
	setup wizzard for windows
	dependencies: make? git? g++. 
	
	stl
	-variables: their position (pointer) will be stored in the first bytes of the memory relative to the end of the file so if the byte array is [1, 0, 0, .... 50] then if you go minus one cell from the begining you will reach the variables
		issues:
			variable size limits
			pointer size limits
	function arguments? 
	if statements?
